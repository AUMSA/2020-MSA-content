## Downloading and setting up  
Git is a free software which you can download to almost any platform. Git is primarily used via the command-line interface, which we can access with our system terminals.
However, we first need to make sure that we have Git installed on our computers.

> You can download Git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

After installing it, start your terminal/command prompt and type the following command to verify that Git is ready to be used on your computer. 

```bash
git --version 
```

If you are using a Mac or Linux machine, then you can utilize the default Bash terminal that comes pre-installed on your machine.

If you are using Windows, you can use its built-in Powershell terminal, or the Git Bash terminal which is bundled with the Git installation.

#### Configuring you name & email
In your terminal, run the following commands to identify yourself with Git:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Replace the values inside the quotes with your name and email address.
