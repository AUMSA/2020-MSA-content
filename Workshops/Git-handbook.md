## Downloading and setting up  
Git is a free software which you can download to almost any platform. Git is primarily used via the command-line interface, which we can access with our system terminals.
However, we first need to make sure that we have Git installed on our computers.

> You can download Git from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

After installing it, start your terminal/command prompt and type the following command to verify that Git is ready to be used on your computer. 

```git --version 
```
