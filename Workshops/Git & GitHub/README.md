# Git & GitHub 

## Introduction 

Git is officially defined as a "distributed version control system" (VCS). 

In other words, it's a system that tracks changes to our project files over time. It enables us to record project changes and go back to a specific version of the tracked files, at any given point in time.  This system can be used by many people to efficiently work together and collaborate on team projects, where each developer can have their own version of the project, distributed on their computer.

GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories. You can use Git on its own without Github (and other similar platforms), but it's difficult to collaborate or share your code with. others. 

## Benefits of GitHub (especially as a student)
1. Industry recognised platform to showcase your projects.  
2. Very easy to contribute to open source projects. 
3. Most companies use Git & GitHub to manage projects. 
4. Often actively asked for in job descriptions & interviews. 
5. Can be a free online backup for personal projects & work so mitigates the risk of losing them.

## How to make open source contributions

You don't always have to code to contribute to open source projects. Checkout the article below for more details. The general method of contributing to open source contributions is to [fork the project](https://github.com/AUMSA/2020-MSA-content/blob/master/Workshops/Git%20&%20GitHub/GitHub-Handbook.md#forking-projects-on-github), [commit your changes](https://github.com/AUMSA/2020-MSA-content/blob/master/Workshops/Git%20%26%20GitHub/Git-handbook.md#staging--commiting) into your forked repo and then [open a pull-request](https://github.com/AUMSA/2020-MSA-content/blob/master/Workshops/Git%20&%20GitHub/GitHub-Handbook.md#creating-a-pull-req) of the developers to review. If you're familiar with any of the steps then click of the hyperlinks.
