# Git & GitHub 

## Introduction 

Git is officially defined as a "distributed version control system" (VCS). 

In other words, it's a system that tracks changes to our project files over time. It enables us to record project changes and go back to a specific version of the tracked files, at any given point in time.  This system can be used by many people to efficiently work together and collaborate on team projects, where each developer can have their own version of the project, distributed on their computer.

GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories. You can use Git on its own without Github (and other similar platforms), but it's difficult to collaborate or share your code with. others.
