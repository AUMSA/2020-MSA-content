# 2020 MSA

MSA in 2020 will have 2 components: 

- Submitting one of the mini projects that the Microsoft Student Partners (MSPâ€™s) will outline in the videos they create
    - AI & Advanced Analytics
    - Cloud Computing with Azure
    - Web App & APIs
- Complete the exercises on the [Microsoft learn platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/) and submit a screenshot of the dashboard
    - The MSP's will outline which exercises you have to watch in the respective GitHub Documentaion.
    - Some courses have fewer MS Learn videos to balance out the work load

It is in your best interest to watch as many videos and upskill as much as you can on all the content created by the MSP's as Phase 2 will incorporate components of each video to create a more complete software system.

These videos will be uploaded to our [YouTube] channel (Comming Soon) - Subscribe and turn on the notification bell to keep up to date.
