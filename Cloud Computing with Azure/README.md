## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Microsoft Student Accelerator Australia 2020 bootcamp on Cloud Computing with Azure. Cloud computing is a very useful technologies as it allows consumers and businesses to use applications without installation and access their personal files at any computer with internet access. If you never heard of Cloud Computing, click [here](https://github.com/AUMSA/2020-MSA-content/blob/master/Cloud%20Computing%20with%20Azure/An%20Introduction%20to%20Cloud%20Computing.md) for a brief introduction to Cloud Computing. This module will teach you the concepts behind Cloud Computing and how to implement it to increase productivity. We will teach you how to create a simple chatbot using the powerful Azure Cloud Services.

### Low/No code Approach
Just like the previous bootcamp, you don't have to worry if you have no coding background. We will be using Azure Marketplace and sandboxes (to give you access to Azure resources) to create and configure a website. Azure Marketplace is an online store that provides many types of applications are available, ranging from AI + Machine Learning to Web applications. We're going to use one of the WordPress application options from the Azure Marketplace for our website.
