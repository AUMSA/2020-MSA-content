# An Introduction to Cloud Computing

## What actually is cloud computing?
Simply put, it is the delivery of computing services throughout the Internet. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence. Here are a few examples of what’s possible today with cloud services from a cloud provider:
1.	Email
2.	Storage, backup, and data retrieval
3.	Creating and testing apps
4.	Analysing data
5.	Audio and video streaming
6.	Delivering software on demand

## Why cloud computing?
Many organisations are turning to cloud computing services because cloud computing is a big shift from the traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Here are 7 reasons:
1.	Cost: Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site data centres
2.	Speed: Most cloud computing services are provided as self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks.
3.	Global Scale: Cloud computing has the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources (e.g. more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth – right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location).
4.	Productivity: Cloud computing removes the need for “racking and stacking” (hardware setup, software patching and other time-consuming IT management chores), so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
5.	Performance: The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure data centres, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate data centre, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.
6.	Reliability: Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.
7.	Security: Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping to protect your data, apps and infrastructure from potential. 

## Types of cloud computing
Not all clouds are the same and not one type of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.

First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment, or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud.

1.	Public cloud- Public clouds are owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers, who deliver their computing resources such as servers and storage over the Internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure are owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.
2.	Private cloud - A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organisation. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site data centre. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.
3.	Hybrid cloud - Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options and helps optimise your existing infrastructure, security and compliance.


## Types of cloud services
Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: 
1.	Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) - The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure – servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems – from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

2.	Platform as a service (PaaS) - Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.

3.	Serverless computing - Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.

4.	Software as a service (SaaS) - Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, such as software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet or PC.
