- [Lecture Slides](https://stdntpartners-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/kaif_ahsan_studentpartner_com/Ec67a5-kyd5AnUjKqHAYvYsBA-_7oSQP4WA6sVyz2SxSmA?e=JbmDFl)

Welcome to the Microsoft Student Accelerator Australia 2020 bootcamp on Cloud Computing with Azure. Cloud computing is one of the most common buzzwords out there and as student we often don't get the chance harness the true potential of cloud. So, through this bootcamp we aim to give some hands-on experience with cloud comptuing using azure to not only understand what it is but also how you can push your career forward using it. If you never heard of Cloud Computing, click [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/) for a brief introduction to Cloud Computing.


#### Low/No code Approach
If you have always thought about having your resume or blog website, then we have some exciting news for you. In this bootcamp we will learn to create, configure and deploy your very own resume/blog website using Azure. We will also explore we can customize and optimise our website to stand out from the crowd. And, yes all this without having to write a single line of code. 

#### Coding Approach
We have for the technical approach. We wouldn't just be exploring cloud computing, we would also going to learning about another amazing technology (and a buzzword) IoT. In this bootcamp by creating our IoT solution, we would be learning how cloud computing and IoT can be utilised together to create solutions to some of the most challenging problems of our current world. 

## 2. Resources

#### Low/No code Approach
