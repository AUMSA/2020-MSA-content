## 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Microsoft Student Accelerator Australia 2020 bootcamp on Cloud Computing with Azure. Cloud Computing is one of the most commonly used buzzwords, and as a student, we usually don't get many chances to harness the true potential of Cloud. So through this bootcamp, we aim to provide some opportunities for hands-on experience with Cloud Computing using Microsoft Azure - so that you are able to understand what Cloud Computing is and how it can accelerate your career. If you have never heard of Cloud, you can [read through the Microsoft Learn module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/) for a brief introduction to Cloud Computing.


### Low/No code Approach
If you have always create your online portfolio, blog or website, then we have some exciting news for you! In this bootcamp, we will learn to create, configure and deploy your very own online resume/blog using Azure. We will also explore how you can customise your website and optimise it to stand out from the crowd. And yes, this can all be done without having to write a single line of code!

### Coding Approach
For those who are more technical, we will go beyond Cloud Computing and also learn IoT, another popular technology. In this bootcamp, you will create your very own IoT solution by utilising knowledge on how Cloud and IoT work together to create solutions to address many of the most challenging problems of the modern world. 

## 2. Resources

### Low/No code Approach

**Main resource**
