## Machine Learning Set-up Guide 

For your machine learning projects, you first have to set-up your environment. These environment is essentially the necessary libraries and packages you are going to use during your machine learning projects. In order to do that you can either use Virtual Environments or use a package manager such as Miniconda. we highly recommend the latter approach. 

Here are is an article what Miniconda is and how to setup your Machine Learning Environment using it. We advise you to read the articles properly to understand what's happening as we **would not** be individually helping everyone to set up their environment.

2. [MacOS/Linux users](https://towardsdatascience.com/get-your-computer-ready-for-machine-learning-how-what-and-why-you-should-use-anaconda-miniconda-d213444f36d6) - (Open in Incognito/Private Window if necessary)

We emphasize again, that this is only one way of doing it and there are many other resources available online and encourage it to troubleshoot if you're having any problems. 

Once you have set-up the local environment, you would probably need a IDE or text editor for your coding and we recommend checking out [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is an free source-code editor with lots of useful built-in tools.
