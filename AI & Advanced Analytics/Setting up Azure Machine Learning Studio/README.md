# Setting up Azure Machine Learning Studio
## Create a workspace
An Azure Machine Learning workspace is a foundational resource in the cloud that you use to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models. It ties your Azure subscription and resource group to an easily consumed object in the service.

You create a workspace via the Azure portal, a web-based console for managing your Azure resources.

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home) by using the credentials for your Azure subscription.
