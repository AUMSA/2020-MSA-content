## Introduction
Welcome to the Microsoft Student Accelerator Australia 2020 bootcamp on AI and Analytics. This module hopes
to teach you the fundamental ideas behind Machine Learning and give you a picture of what it looks like to use Machine Learning and why it's useful. Machine learning is one of the emerging technologies which has the power to change the world and we would like to enable everyone to harness it power. Hence, in this bootcamp, students from all background will be taught on how to get started with Machine Learning. Click [here](https://github.com/AUMSA/2020-MSA-content/blob/master/AI%20%26%20Advanced%20Analytics/Introduction%20to%20Machine%20Learning.md) for an introduction to machine learning.

### Low/No code Approach
For those who don't have any prior coding experience, we will be leveraging Azure Machine Learning Studio to
create a Machine Learning model without writing any code. The Designer tool in ML Studio enables us to
develop our project by dragging and dropping appropriate layers. Click [here](https://github.com/AUMSA/2020-MSA-content/tree/master/AI%20%26%20Advanced%20Analytics/Setting%20up%20Azure%20Machine%20Learning%20Studio) for tutorial on setting up Machine Learning Studio.

### Coding Approach
We have catered our program to code wizards to who want to get their hands dirty. In this bootcamp we will be
exploring many core concepts of Machine Learning through creating the program from scratch using Python and
Azure Notebooks. Click [here](https://github.com/AUMSA/2020-MSA-content/tree/master/AI%20%26%20Advanced%20Analytics/Setting%20up%20Azure%20Notebook) for tutorial on setting up Azure Notebook.

### Coding Approach:
- You can have a look at this MS learn 6 hours course which would take your skill from beginner to intermediate (yes you read it right 6 hours!!)-
  https://aischool.microsoft.com/en-us/machine-learning/learning-paths/ml-crash-course

- Visit this cool MS learn link to know about many more conventional AI projects. Happy learning-
  https://aischool.microsoft.com/en-us/conversational/learning-paths

- The MS learn video on Machine Learning is a good place to start. It'll give you a basic understanding of what Machine Learning is so you can understand the concepts discussed in this video a little better. We recommend reading through it beforehand. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/intro-to-ml-with-python/

#### Extra Resources
- General Data Analysis information: https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
- This Pandas cheat sheet is good to have by: https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

- If you want to go deeper and then this Full course on Machine Learning by Stanford university might come handy. You could find it here-

## Project
To consolidate your learning from this bootcamp, you are required to complete a project. Apart from learning purposes,
you can also share this project in your CV/resume and it might be useful in your future job search.
The projects are mandatory and part of this bootcamp's assessment. You **must** complete the project with the following guidelines:

#### Low/No Coding Approach: 
- This guidelines are valid if you're using Azure Machine Learning Designer.
- You have to add a proper description and summary of the project. 
- In the description section explain the source of the dataset 

#### Coding Approach: 
- You have to upload and maintain a GitHub repository for your project
- Your project **must not** have only one commit. We need to check commit history to ensure the validity of the project
- If it's a code file, it **must** have comments to explain the major steps in your code
- Add a README.md file explaining your project idea.

#### Sample projects: 
Here's a list of cool projects ideas to inspire you:
