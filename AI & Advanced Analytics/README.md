# MSA 2020 - AI & Advanced Analytics

## Introduction 

Welcome to the Microsoft Student Accelerator Australia  2020 bootcamp on AI and Analytics. This module hopes 
to teach you the fundamental ideas behind Machine Learning and give you a picture of what it looks like to use Machine Learning and why it's useful. Machine learning is one of the emerging technologies which has the power to change the world and we would like to enable everyone to harness it power. Hence, in this bootcamp students from all background on how to get started with Machine Learning.  

### Low/No code Approach 
For those who don't have any prior coding experience, we will be leveraging Azure Machine Learning Studio to 
create a Machine Learning model without writing any code. The Designer tool in ML Studio enables such to 
develop our project by dragging and dropping appropriate layers. 

### Coding Approach 
We have catered our program to code wizards to who want to get their hands dirty. In this bootcamp we will be 
exploring many core concepts of Machine Learning through creating the program from scratch using Python and 
Azure Notebooks. 


## How to complete this bootcamp 
To complete this bootcamp you need to submit a project and complete the Microsoft Learn Modules given in the 
assignment section in this project. We recommend the following this order: 

1. Explore the resources section & complete Microsoft Learn Modules. 
2. Check-out the demo project.
3. Select a project from the sample ideas or pick your own idea 
4. Complete & submit project according to guidelines mentioned in Project Section. 

If you're taking using Azure Machine Learning Studio then check out this quick start guide. 
Or, if you're developing using Python and Azure Notebooks, check the quick start guide here. 


## Resources
- You can have a look at this MS learn 6 hours course which would take your skill from beginner to            intermediate (yes you read it right 6 hours!!)-

- The MS learn video on Machine Learning is a good place to start. It'll give you a basic understanding of what Machine Learning is so you can understand the concepts discussed in this video a little better. We recommend reading through it beforehand. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/intro-to-ml-with-python/


#### Extra Resources
- General Data Analysis information: https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book
- This Pandas cheat sheet is good to have by: https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

- If you want to go deeper and then this Full course on Machine Learning by Stanford university might come handy. You could find it here-

## Project 
To consolidate your learning from this bootcamp we suggest completing a projects. Apart form learning purposes
you can also share this project in your CV/resume and might be useful in your future job search.
The projects are also mandatory and part of this bootcamp's assessment. You must complete the project with the following guidelines: 
- You have to upload and maintain a GitHub repo for your project 
- Your project must not have only one commit. We need to check commit history to ensure validity project 
- If it's a code file, it must have comments to explain the major steps in your code 
- Add a README.md file explaining your project idea. 

Here's a list of cool projects ideas to inspire you: 
1. Idea - Dataset 
2. Idea - Dataset 
3. Idea - Dataset 

If you have our own project idea then feel free to implement that. However, please make sure you README file 
contain enough information about what your project is about. 

## Assignment: 
For your assessment you need to complete 

#### Part-1  
To assist you finishing learn the tools and complete the project, we have created two Introductory Lessons. We
suggest you complete these first before proceeding with your projects.

**Task** 
 - If you're using Azure Machine Learning Studio then first read this [short guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/what-is-ml-studio). And then complete this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/create-experiment). 

- If you will code you own project then complete this [Microsoft Learn Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/intro-to-ml-with-python/).
 
#### Part-2
Complete one project for the ideas mentioned above or of your choice. You can complete the project with either using Azure Machine Learning Studio or code up the project using Azure Notebooks or similar tools.
