# MSA 2020 - AI & Advanced Analytics

## Introduction 

Welcome to the Microsoft Student Accelerator Australia  2020 bootcamp on AI and Analytics. This module hopes 
to teach you the fundamental ideas behind Machine Learning and give you a picture of what it looks like to use Machine Learning and why it's useful. Machine learning is one of the emerging technologies which has the power to change the world and we would like to enable everyone to harness it power. Hence, in this bootcamp students from all background on how to get started with Machine Learning.  

### Low/No code Approach 
For those who don't have any prior coding experience, we will be leveraging Azure Machine Learning Studio to 
create a Machine Learning model without writing any code. The Designer tool in ML Studio enables such to 
develop our project by dragging and dropping appropriate layers. 

### Coding Approach 
We have catered our program to code wizards to who want to get their hands dirty. In this bootcamp we will be 
exploring many core concepts of Machine Learning through creating the program from scratch using Python and 
Azure Notebooks. 


## How to complete this bootcamp 
To complete this bootcamp you need to submit a project and complete the Microsoft Learn Modules given in the 
assignment section in this project. We recommend the following this order: 

1. Explore the resources section & complete Microsoft Learn Modules. 
2. Check-out the demo project.
3. Select a project from the sample ideas or pick your own idea 
4. Complete & submit project according to guidelines mentioned in Project Section. 

If you're taking using Azure Machine Learning Studio then check out this quick start guide. 
Or, if you're developing using Python and Azure Notebooks, check the quick start guide here.
