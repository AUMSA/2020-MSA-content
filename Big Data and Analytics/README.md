# 2019-Phase-1 - Big Data and Analytics

## Introduction
The big data and analytics module will focus on transforming data into insightful information. We will be loading a large dataset to Azure Notebooks where we will clean, transform and store the data we manipulate. With the use of Power BI we will then import our transformed data to create useful visualisations.

## Learning Outcomes
- Learn how to create and use an Azure Notebooks project
- Become comfortable manipulating large datasets
- Use csv files created in Azure Notebooks in Power BI
- Create visualisation using Power BI

## Requirements
- An Azure for Students subscription
- A Microsoft account (Hotmail, Outlook etc)
- Power BI Desktop Application
    - For those who have a Mac, you will need to create a VM running windows as Power BI is Windows only
- Some basic knowledge on one of the following languages (not required but will make things easier):
    - Python, R, SQL
- Enthusiasm

## Contents

### Part 1 - Azure Notebooks
In this subsection we will learn how to set up an Azure notebooks porject to perform ETL. We will go through connecting into your notebooks workspace, where we will create a notebook. We will upload a large dataset and within the created notebook we will use Python (however you can use R, or SQL if you prefer) to perform operations on it. We will then convert these dataframes into CSV files which we can then use in Part 2 in Power BI.

### Part 2 - Power BI
In this subsection we will create an account to use PowerBI. We will connect to our Azure Databricks workspace so that we can get the data we transformed in Part 1. We will learn and create various visualisations.

## Assignment
For your assignment, you will need to:
- Select a different dataset. You can use more than one datasets if you like. (Hint: Head over to Kaggle to find a variety of datasets).
- Create an Azure Notebooks project and a notebook(s)
- Load your selected dataset and perform at least 3 or more **useful** types of transformations on the data. If you decide to do a format revision transformation as per the documentation, please dont just copy the currency conversion example. (Examples of transformation types are in the Part 1 documentation or at [this link](https://www.stitchdata.com/etldatabase/etl-transform/))
- Create and save a new CSV file(s) based on the manipulations you performed above.
- Use these CSV file(s) in Power
- Create visualisations in Power BI using the above csv(s).

### Submission
Submissions will be done through the portal that we will provide to you.

You will need to submit:
- Your public Azure Notebooks project url. This repo should be the following:
    - Your Azure Notebooks project file
    - CSV file(s) of all the transformed data tables you create
    - Screenshots of your visualisations you create on Power BI
- Screenshot(s) of your Microsoft Learn profile dashboard showing your completed modules.
